/**
 * This class implements the Ultrasonic Sensor Poller for our Wall Follower.

 * loop at the bottom executes in a loop. Assuming that the us.fetchSample, and cont.processUSData
 * methods operate in about 20mS, and that the thread sleeps for 50 mS at the end of each loop, then
 * one cycle through the loop is approximately 70 mS. This corresponds to a sampling rate of 1/70mS
 * or about 14 Hz.
